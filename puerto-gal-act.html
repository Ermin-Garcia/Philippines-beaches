                    <h3>Jet Ski Riding</h3>                              
                    <p>
                        Jet skis are almost universally considered a whole lot of fun, and very 
                        easy to operate. Unfortunately, this does not translate to them also 
                        being safe, so while it is possible to have an enjoyable time on a jet 
                        ski without suffering any injuries, there are several things you should 
                        remember to help you do so.

                    <h3>Flyboarding</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Flyboard rider stands on a board connected by a long hose to a watercraft. 
                        Water is forced under pressure to a pair of boots with jet nozzles 
                        underneath which provide thrust for the rider to fly up to 22 m (72 ft) 
                        in the air or to dive headlong through the water down as far as one is 
                        willing to go.

                    <h3>Parasailing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Parasailing is a water sport that involves being harnessed to a wide wing 
                        or sail-like parachute, which is tethered to a motorboat. Participants 
                        are lifted into the air while connected to the boat, allowing them to 
                        glide above the water's surface.
