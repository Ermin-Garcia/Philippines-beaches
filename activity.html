                        The Sunken Cemetery, also known as the Old Volcano is a popular sight 
                        seeing spot with history. During the 1800s, Mount Vulcan erupted causing 
                        the massive devastation on the island. The eruption caused the cemetery 
                        and the old capital city to sink below sea level.
